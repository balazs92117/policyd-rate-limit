policyd-rate-limit (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #831456)
  * Disable the usage of upstream init scripts (patch ignore-init-service.patch)
    and use policyd-rate-limit.service and policyd-rate-limit.init instead.
    They are identical to the upstream ones except for /usr/local/bin/ replaced
    by /usr/bin/. It also let dh_installdeb automatically setup symbolic links
    in rc* in postinst and postrm.
